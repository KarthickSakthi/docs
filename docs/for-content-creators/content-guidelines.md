## Introduction

Welcome to our content guidelines  This page is your comprehensive guide to understanding the core principles and standards that shape the content on our platform.

In this document, we provide detailed guidance on what we look for in content, what we prioritize, and under what conditions we might remove content.

:::info
In our ongoing effort to maintain a balanced content inventory on the platform, we are temporarily giving higher priority to niche sources during our review process. This allows us to provide our developer community with a diverse range of topics and unique perspectives. As a result, we may apply more strict judgment on mainstream content. This is to ensure that our platform maintains a healthy mix of content and caters to various interests within the global developer community.

### When will we reject, ban or remove content?

❌ Content that is irrelevant for developers.

❌ Content that is used only or primarily for self-promotion.

❌ Content that is not written in English.

❌ Content from sources that were not active in the past three months or more.

❌ Content from sources that don't provide an RSS feed available for public use.

❌ Content about politically-oriented topics.

❌ Content that is generated through programmatic SEO or any similar method to populate content. This includes publications that might not use programmatic SEO but can be perceived as doing so.

❌ Content that fails to comply with standard SEO best practices. For more information, refer to this [SEO reference guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide#understand_your_content).

❌ Content that is generated by artificial intelligence (AI), automated algorithms, or any form of automated content generation methods. This includes content that may not be directly generated by AI but exhibits characteristics typical of AI-generated content, such as overly generic information, lack of personal perspective, or noticeable patterns in language structure.

❌ Content that is either illegal, pornographic (including mature in content or overtly sexual), racist, sexist (or otherwise offensive), grotesque (or obscene), inflammatory, and other inappropriate content.

❌ Content that incites violence or hatred towards an individual or group based on race, religion, gender identity or expression, sex, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, age, disability, or other characteristics associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization.

### Additional guidelines for corporate blogs

In addition to the general guidelines above, corporate blogs that wish to pass the review process should also consider the following specific guidelines:

✅ Content from a dedicated RSS feed that is free of promotional material or company updates such as press releases, customer use cases, funding announcements, product updates, or any similar content.

### Additional guidelines for personal blogs

At the moment, the basic rule of thumb in our review process is that we do not approve personal blogs as sources. However, we recently started working gradually towards allowing personal blogs on the platform. During this interim period, we will only approve personal blogs that meet specific criteria. If you're submitting a personal blog for review, please ensure it meets the following guidelines:

✅ Personal blog of a global thought leader who has a significant impact on the developer community.

✅ Focused on niche topics that cater to specific and non-mainstream interests.

Please note that these additional guidelines for personal blogs are subject to change as we continue to refine our review process.

### Update regarding AI-generated content

At daily.dev, we recognize the technological advancements and capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in generating content. However, our priority remains to spotlight and uphold content that is the product of human insight, expertise, and lived experiences.

We believe that it is through this emphasis on human-created content that we can ensure the authenticity, validity, and reliability of the information shared across our platform. We value the unique perspectives, nuanced understanding, and the richness of thought that comes with human authorship.

While AI has demonstrated an ability to create increasingly convincing content, we believe it's important to maintain a clear distinction between human and AI-generated content to preserve the integrity and personal touch inherent in human writing. This stance aligns with our commitment to fostering a genuine, insightful, and engaging community.

We appreciate your understanding and adherence to this policy.

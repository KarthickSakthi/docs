3. **Send Invitations**: use your personal invitation link and send it via email, your favorite messaging app or post it on social media.

Remember, the growth of your Squad depends on the active participation of its members. Encourage your members to invite their peers who may be interested in the topics you're discussing.

## Managing Posts

In a Squad, posts form the backbone of discussion and engagement. They are where you and your members can share valuable content and start meaningful discussions.

## Creating a Post

2. **Add Content**: You can write a post from scratch or share links from the daily.dev feed or external sources. Add a title and description for the content to provide context to your members.
3. **Post**: Click "Post" to share your content with the Squad.
